# Interactive-Form
 An interactive form programmed with Vanilla JS and built with accessibility in mind.  We were not allowed to directly alter HTML or CSS to add functionality. The "Email Address:" form field demonstrates real time validation and conditional error messaging.  This functionality can be found between lines 177 and 188.
